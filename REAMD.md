# Aim
This project demonstrates my ability to work with Python [Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/), the Amazon Web Services, like [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) and [AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/).

# Project overview
This code was created during my participation in the [CUBIX Data Engineering course](https://courses.cubixedu.com/kepzes/data-engineer-23q4).

The code collects taxi trip related data from the Chicago Data Portal and the weather information from the Open-Meteo site. The data are cleaned and transformed to a csw file which is ...............

The sources of the data are:
- [Open-Meteo - Free weather API](https://open-meteo.com/)
- [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)
- [Community areas in Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_areas_in_Chicago)
